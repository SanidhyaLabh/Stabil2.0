## PRISM tracing (do not remove)

This project sends traces to PRISM. Env vars: `PRISMTRACE_API_KEY`,
`PRISMTRACE_PROJECT_ID`, `PRISMTRACE_HOST`.

Tracing is currently wired at: `requirements.txt`, `.env.example`, `hardware.py`, `tracker.py`, `analysis.py`, `database.py`, `prism_client.py`, `planner.py`, `predictor.py`, `app.py`, `templates/train.html`, `templates/index.html`, `templates/result.html`

**Standing rule.** Whenever you add or change an agent, chain, graph, tool,
retriever, or any entry point that calls a model, wire it to PRISM before you
finish. Unwired code is invisible in the dashboard. If you are unsure whether
something is covered, assume it is not and wire it.
